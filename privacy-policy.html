            our Services you interact with and the amount of time you spend time using the same. </p>
        <h3>1.1. Data You Provide to Us</h3>
        <p>We may collect data from or about you depending on how you use the Services. Below are some examples to help
            you better understand the data we collect. When you create an account and/or use the Services, including
            through a third-party platform, we collect any data you provide directly, including:</p>

            <li><strong>1.1.1. Account Data:</strong> In order to use certain features (like enrolling in a course), you
                need to create a user account. When you create or update your account, we collect and store the data you
                provide, like your email address, password, gender, and date of birth; and assign you a unique
                identifying number (“Account Data”).</li>
            <li><strong>1.1.2. Profile Data:</strong>You can also choose to provide profile information like a photo,
                headline, website link, social media profiles, or other data. Your Profile Data will be publicly

                content publicly, including by posting reviews, asking or answering questions, sending messages to other

                viewable by others depending on where it is posted. </li>
            <li><strong>1.1.4. Payment Data:</strong> If you make purchases, we collect certain data about your purchase
                (such as your name and zip code) as necessary to process your order. You must provide certain payment

                platform or service decide to give us. If you access or use our Services through a third-party platform
