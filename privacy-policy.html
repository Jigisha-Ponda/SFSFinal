        <h2>4. Ownership of Content</h2>
        <p>All images, text and other content you provide to or via a SFS or affiliated website becomes the property of

        <h2>5. Cookies and Data Collection Tools</h2>
        <p>As detailed in our Cookie Policy below, SFS and service providers acting on our behalf (like Google Analytics
            and third party advertisers) use server log files and automated data collection tools like cookies, tags,
            scripts, customized links, device or browser fingerprints, and web beacons (together, “Data Collection
            Tools”) when you access and use the Services. These Data Collection Tools automatically track and collect
            certain System Data and Usage Data (as detailed in Section 1) when you use the Services. In some cases, we
            tie data gathered through those Data Collection Tools to other data that we collect as described in this
            Privacy Policy. We use cookies (small files that websites send to your device to uniquely identify your
            browser or device or to store data in your browser) for things like analyzing your use of the Services,
            personalizing your experience, making it easier to log into the Services, and recognizing you when you
            return. We use web beacons (small objects that allow us to measure the actions of visitors and users using
            the Services) for things like identifying whether a page was visited, identifying whether an email was
            opened, and advertising more efficiently by excluding current users from certain promotional messages or
            identifying the source of a new mobile app download.</p>

                set for video/audio call playback).</li>
            <li><strong>5.1.4. Session State:</strong> Cookies that track your interactions with the Services to help us
                improve the Services and your browsing experience, remember your login details, and enable processing of
                your course purchases. These are strictly necessary for the Services to work properly, so if you disable
                them then certain functionalities will break or be unavailable. You can set your web browser to alert
                you about attempts to place cookies on your computer, limit the types of cookies you allow, or refuse
                cookies altogether. If you do, you may not be able to use some or all features of the Services, and your
                experience may be different or less functional. </li>
            <li><strong>5.1.5.</strong> Some of the third-party partners who provide certain features on our site may
                also use Local Storage Objects (also known as flash cookies or LSOs) to collect and store data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Analytics</h2>
        <p>We use third-party browser and mobile analytics services. These services use Data Collection Tools to help us
            analyse your use of the Services, including information like the third-party website you arrive from, how
            often you visit, events within the Services, usage and performance data, and where the application was
            downloaded from. We use this data to improve the Services, better understand how the Services perform on
            different devices, and provide information that may be of interest to you. </p>

        <h2>7. Online Advertising</h2>
        <p> We use third-party advertising services like ad networks and ad servers to deliver advertising about our
            Services on other websites and applications you use. The ads may be based on things we know about you, like
            your Usage Data, System Data and things that these ad service providers know about you based on their
            tracking data. The ads can be based on your recent activity or activity over time and across other sites and
            services, and may be tailored to your interests. Depending on the types of advertising services we use, they
            may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, phone, or other device to collect data
            about your use of our Services, and may access those tracking technologies in order to deliver these
            tailored advertisements to you. To help deliver tailored advertising, we may provide these service providers
            with an anonymized version of your email address (in a non-human-readable form) and content that you share
            publicly on the Services.</p>

                needed. De-identified data means data where we’ve removed things like your name and email address and
                replaced it with a token ID. This allows these providers to provide analytics services or match your
                data with publicly-available database information (including contact and social information from other
                sources). We do this to communicate with you in a more effective and customized manner. </li>
            <li><strong>9.5. To Administer Promotions and Surveys: </strong>We may share your data as necessary to
                administer, market, or sponsor promotions and surveys you choose to participate in, as required by
                applicable law (like to provide a winners’ list or make required filings), or in accordance with the
                rules of the promotion or survey.</li>
            <li><strong>9.6. For Advertising:</strong>We may use and share certain System Data and Usage Data with
                third-party advertisers and networks regarding general demographic and preference information of our
                users. We may also allow advertisers to collect System Data through Data Collection Tools (as detailed
                in Section 2.1), and to use this data to offer you targeted ad delivery to personalize your user
                experience (through behavioral advertising) and undertake web analytics. Advertisers may also share with
                us the data they collect about you. To learn more or opt out from participating ad networks’ behavioral
                advertising, see Section 6.1 (Your Choices About the Use of Your Data) below. Note that if you opt out,
                you’ll continue to be served generic ads.</li>
            <li><strong>9.7. For Security and Legal Compliance:</strong>We may disclose your data to third parties if we
                (in our sole discretion) have a good faith belief that the disclosure is:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>9.7.1. </strong>Permitted or required by law</li>

                        or proceeding</li>
                    <li><strong>9.7.3. </strong>Reasonably necessary as part of a valid subpoena, warrant, or other
                        legally-valid request</li>
                    <li><strong>9.7.4. </strong>Reasonably necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and
                        other legal agreements</li>
                    <li><strong>9.7.5. </strong>Required to detect, prevent, or address fraud, abuse, misuse, potential
                        violations of law (or rule or regulation), or security or technical issues; or</li>
                    <li><strong>9.7.6. </strong>Reasonably necessary in our discretion to protect against imminent harm

                        Services.</li>
                    <li><strong>9.7.7. </strong>We may also disclose data about you to our auditors and legal advisors

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>9.8. During a Change in Control:</strong>If SFS undergoes a business transaction like a merger,
                acquisition, corporate divestiture, or dissolution (including bankruptcy), or a sale of all or some of
                its assets, we may share, disclose, or transfer all of your data to the successor organization during
                such transition or in contemplation of a transition (including during due diligence).</li>
            <li><strong>9.9. After Aggregation/De-identification:</strong> We can disclose or use aggregate or
                de-identified data for any purpose</li>
            <li><strong>9.10. With Your Permission:</strong>with your consent, we may share data with third parties
                outside the scope of this Privacy Policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Security</h2>
        <p>We use appropriate security based on the type and sensitivity of data being stored. As with any
            internet-enabled system, there is always a risk of unauthorized access, so it’s important to protect your
            password, change it at least every three months, and to promptly contact us if you suspect any unauthorized
            access of your account.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>10.1. </strong>SFS takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access,
                alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal data that we collect and store. These measures
                vary based on the type and sensitivity of the data. Unfortunately, however, no system can be 100%
                secured, so we cannot guarantee that communications between you and SFS, the Services, or any
                information provided to us in connection with the data we collect through the Services will be free from
                unauthorized access by third parties. Your password is an important part of our security system, and it
                is your responsibility to protect it. You should not share your password with any third party, and if
                you believe your password or account has been compromised, you should change it immediately and contact
                us with any concerns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have certain rights regarding the use of your data, including the ability to opt out of promotional
            emails, cookies, and collection of your data by certain analytics providers. You can update or terminate
            your account from within the Services, and can also contact us with individual rights requests concerning
            your personal data. Parents who believe we’ve (unintentionally) collected personal data about their underage
            child should contact us for help deleting that information.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Your Choices About the Use of Your Data</h2>
        <p>You can choose:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>12.1. </strong>Not to provide certain data to us, but if you do so you may not be able to use
                certain features of the Services.</li>
            <li><strong>12.2. </strong>To stop receiving promotional communications from us. You can opt out by using
                the unsubscribe mechanism in the promotional communication you receive or by changing the email
                preferences in your account profile. Regardless of your email preference settings, we will send you
                transactional and relationship messages regarding the Services, including administrative confirmations,
                order confirmations, important updates about the Services, and notices about our policies. </li>
            <li><strong>12.3. </strong>The browser or device you use may allow you to control cookies and other types of
                local data storage. Your wireless device may also allow you to control whether location or other data is
                collected and shared.</li>
            <li><strong>12.4. </strong>If you have any questions about your data, our use of it, or your rights, contact
                us</li>
            <li><strong>12.5. </strong>Device Information & Identifiers. We collect limited device information to ensure
                the security and integrity of our services. Specifically, we use a device identifier (such as
                getUniqueId() on Android and iOS) to uniquely recognize devices interacting with our application.
                <ol type="a">
                    <li><strong>What We Collect:</strong> We collect and store only a hashed version of the device’s
                        unique ID. We do not store or transmit the original/raw device ID. The hash is not reversible,
                        meaning it cannot be used to reconstruct or identify the original ID. </li>
                    <li><strong>Why We Collect This: </strong>We process this information to detect and prevent fraud
                        and abuse; to help identify devices in a privacy-preserving way (e.g., limiting fake
                        registrations or enforcing account limits per device); and to maintain the security and
                        integrity of our systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>How We Use and Store This Information:</strong> The hashed ID is stored securely and
                        used only for internal purposes. We do not share this data with third parties. All data is
                        transmitted securely using encryption protocols (e.g., HTTPS/TLS). We comply with all applicable
                        privacy regulations (including but not limited to GDPR and CCPA). </li>
                    <li><strong>Your Rights:</strong> You may contact us at [your support email] to request deletion of
                        any associated data. Please note that since we do not store the original device ID, we cannot
                        retrieve or reconstruct it from our system.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>13. Terminating Your Account</h2>
        <p>Accessing, Updating, and Deleting Your Personal Data. You can terminate your account, access, update and
            delete your personal data that SFS collects and maintains as follows: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>13.1.</strong> To update data you provide directly, log into your account and update your
                account profile at any time. </li>
            <li><strong>13.2.</strong> To terminate your account:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>13.2.1.</strong> Please note: even after your account is terminated, some or all of your
                        data may still be visible to others, such as (but not limited to) any data that has been (a)
                        copied, stored, or disseminated by other users (including in-course comment); (b) shared or
                        disseminated by you or others (including in your shared content); or (c) posted to a third-party
                        platform. After your account is terminated, we retain your data for as long as we have a
                        legitimate purpose to do so (and in accordance with applicable law), including to assist with
                        legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We may retain and disclose such
                        data pursuant to this Privacy Policy after your account has been terminated. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>13.3.</strong> To request to access, correct, or delete your personal data, email us or write to
                us at SFS. Please allow up to 30 days for a response. For your protection, we may require that the
                request be sent through the email address associated with your account, and we may need to verify your
                identity before implementing your request. Please note that we retain certain data where we have a
                lawful reason to do so, including for mandatory record-keeping and to complete transactions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>14. Our Policy Concerning Children</h2>
        <p>We recognize the privacy interests of children and encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in
            their children’s online activities and interests. Children under 18 years of age should not be permitted to
            use the Services. Parents who believe that SFS may have collected personal data from a child under the age
            of 18 years can submit a request that corresponding information be removed to our email. </p>

        <h2>15. Users in California</h2>
        <p> California resident users have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act, (“CCPA”). If you
            are an eligible California user, included in these rights are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>15.1. Right to Know</strong> You have the right to know more about the categories and specific
                pieces of personal information that we collect about you and access a copy of your collected personal
                information.</li>
            <li><strong>15.2. Right to Deletion</strong> You have the right to request deletion of personal information
                that we have collected about you.</li>
            <li><strong>15.3. Right to Non-Discrimination</strong> If you choose to exercise any of your rights under
                CCPA, SFS will treat you like all other users. In other words, there is no penalty for exercising your
                rights under CCPA.</li>
            <li><strong>15.4. </strong>To exercise any of these rights under CCPA, please email us. As part of the CCPA
                you may designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf. For your protection, we may
                require that the request be sent through the email address associated with your account, and we may
                verify you and/or your agent’s identity before fulfilling your request. </li>
            <li><strong>15.5. </strong>For more information about the personal data we collect and how we collect it,
                please see the sections above entitled “What Data We Collect” and “How We Get Data About You.”</li>
            <li><strong>15.6. </strong>To learn about the business and commercial purposes for which your personal
                information is collected and the categories of service providers who have access to your personal
                information, please see the sections above entitled “What We Use Your Data For” and “Who We Share Your
                Data With.</li>

                personal information we share with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To
                submit your request, send an email with the phrase “California Shine the Light” and include your mailing
                address, state of residence, and email address. Since the internet industry is still working on Do Not
                Track standards, solutions, and implementation, we do not currently recognize or respond to
                browser-initiated Do Not Track signals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>24. Cookie Policy</h2>
        <p>Cookies serve to remember information about user visits to the SFS website(s), like preferred language, and
            to make the site easier to use. SFS uses both session cookies, which expire after a short time or when you
            close your browser, and persistent cookies, which remain stored in your browser for a set period of time.
            Session cookies are used to identify each user during a single browsing session, like when you log into SFS.
            Persistent cookies are used to identify users over a longer period, like when you request that we keep you
            signed in. Cookies and similar technologies like web beacons, pixel tags, and local shared objects (“flash
            cookies”) are used to deliver, measure, and improve Services; and are used when accessing the website(s)
            through a browser and through the SFS mobile app. Additional user data may be gathered through other
            methods. Purposes for which cookies are used include the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>24.1. Authentication and Security</strong> To log users into SFS; to protect user security; to
                help detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate SFS’ policies or agreements. For
                example, cookies help authenticate user access to the SFS website(s) and prevent unauthorized parties
                from accessing user accounts. </li>
            <li><strong>24.2. Preferences</strong> To remember data about your browser and your preferences; to remember
                user settings and other user choices you’ve made. For example, cookies help SFS remember your preferred
                language or the country you’re in, so we can provide content in your preferred language without asking
                each time you visit.</li>
            <li><strong>24.3. Analytics and Research</strong> To help SFS improve and understand how people use its
                website(s). For example, cookies help test different versions of the website(s) to determine which
                features or content users prefer; web beacons help determine which email messages are opened, and
                cookies help determine how users interact with the website(s), like the links they most frequently click
                on. SFS also works with a number of analytics partners, including Google Analytics, who use cookies and
                similar technologies to help SFS analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the sites from
                which they arrive. Those service providers may collect that data themselves or SFS may disclose it to
                them.</li>
            <li><strong>24.4. Personalized Content</strong> To customize the SFS website(s) with more relevant content.
                For example, cookies enable display of a personalized list of recommended courses or programs.</li>
            <li><strong>24.5. Targeted Advertising</strong> To provide users with more relevant advertising. Where
                advertising technology is integrated into the Services, users may receive advertising on other websites
                and applications, but it will not be tailored to your interests. </li>
            <li><strong>24.6. Privacy Options</strong> Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change
                your browser settings to decline cookies by consulting your browser’s support articles. If you decide to
                decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some interactive features in the
                Services.</li>
            <li><strong>Updates</strong> From time to time, SFS may update this Cookie Policy. If so, users will be
                notified by posting the policy on the website(s) with a new effective date. If SFS makes any material
                changes, reasonable steps will be taken to notify users in advance of the planned change. </li>
        </ul>
