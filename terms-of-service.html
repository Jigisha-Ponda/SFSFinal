            <li>Copyright dispute policy: Indemnification Under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”),
                online service providers such as SFS have the right, but not the obligation, to remove material that
                allegedly violates someone’s copyright. We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and reserve the
                right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat
                alleged infringers. As a user, you agree to indemnify SFS and hold it harmless as to any claims or
                lawsuits arising out of such copyright infringement regarding content you have provided. SFS is not
                responsible for any content posted by the users.</li>
            <li>Third party service providers The website(s) and Services may contain links to third party websites,
                products or services that are not owned or controlled by SFS (“Third Party Services”). When you access
                Third Party Services, you do so at your own risk. SFS encourages you to be aware when you leave its
                website(s) and to read the terms, conditions and privacy policy of each Third-Party Website or Service
                that you visit or use. SFS has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content,
                accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any Third-Party Services. In
                addition, SFS will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any Third-Party
                Services. By using the Services, you expressly relieve and hold harmless SFS from any and all liability
                arising from your use of any Third-Party Services. Your interactions with organizations and/or
                individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of services, and any other
                terms, with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should
                make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or
                offline transaction with any third parties. You agree that SFS will not be responsible or liable for any
                loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings. If there is a dispute between
                SFS users, or between SFS users and any third party, you understand and agree that SFS is under no
                obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you
                hereby release SFS, its officers, employees, agents, consultants and successors in rights from claims,
                demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or
                unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or the
                Services. If you are a California resident, you will and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section
                1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or
                suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have
                materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” While using SFS, you may be able to access or use
                third party services that aren’t part of our product (such as YouTube, Flickr, etc.). SFS shall not be
                responsible for the content of services or any issues that arise.</li>
            <li>Warranty and disclaimer TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SFS OR ITS
                SUPPLIERS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS BE LIABLE
                WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES OR THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE,
                TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, DEFAMATION, OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY: 1. FOR ANY AMOUNT IN THE
                AGGREGATE IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF $100 OR THE FEES PAID BY YOU TO SFS HEREUNDER DURING THE 12-MONTH
                PERIOD PRECEDING THE APPLICABLE CLAIM; 2. FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
                DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER; 3. FOR DATA LOSS OR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES;
                OR 4. FOR ANY MATTER BEYOND SFS’ REASONABLE CONTROL. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
                LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY
                TO YOU.<br />
                SFS is a communication tool. While we are here to support you, we are not liable for anything that

            </li>
            <li>Termination This Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. You may
                terminate your use of the Services or your account at any time by deleting your account in your account
                settings tab or by contacting us. If you become a user through an Organization, and you request that SFS

                your account at any time, for any reason (for your violation of any term of this Agreement or without
                cause), and without warning or notice, which may result in the forfeiture of all information associated
                with your account. Upon termination of your account, your right to use the Services and any Content will
                immediately cease; however, SFS may retain messaging data or other data and information pursuant to this
                Agreement, as necessary for auditing purposes, and as required by law. All provisions of this Agreement
                which, by their nature, should survive termination, will survive termination, including, without
                limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability. You can delete
                your SFS account online at any time.</li>
            <li>Choice of law and arbitration This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
                laws of the State of New Jersey, U.S.A. without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. Any
                dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement will be resolved by arbitration
                in the State of New York, County of New York, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
                American Arbitration Association.</li>
            <li>Miscellaneous The failure of either party to exercise, in any respect, any right provided for herein
                will not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. SFS will not be liable for any failure to
                perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond its reasonable
                control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation.
                If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be
                limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in
                full force and effect. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except
                with SFS’ prior written consent. SFS may transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement and its rights and
                obligations without your consent. Both parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive
                statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and
                oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this
                Agreement, and that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise
                provided herein. This Agreement and any subsequent versions of this Agreement posted to the SFS
                website(s) will be deemed accepted upon use thereafter by you. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or
                employment relationship is created as a result of this Agreement. You do not have any authority of any
                kind to bind SFS in any way whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Severability If any provision of the Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitral
                tribunal to be unenforceable under applicable law, then such provision shall be excluded from this
                Agreement and the remainder of the Agreement shall be interpreted as if such provision were so excluded
                and shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms; provided however that, in such event, the
                Agreement shall be interpreted so as to give effect, to the greatest extent consistent with and
                permitted by applicable law, to the meaning and intention of the excluded provision as determined by
                such court of competent jurisdiction or arbitral tribunal.</li>
            <li>Subscription services You agree to notify SFS immediately, in writing or by mail to or by calling SFS
                customer care on, if your content is stolen or if you become aware at any time that your account with
                any Service is being misused or being used fraudulently. When you call or write, you must provide your
                account details and a detailed description of the circumstances of the theft or fraudulent use of the
                Services. Failure to do so promptly or within a reasonably prompt time period after discovery of the
                improper use may result in the termination of your Services and additional charges to you. You will be
                liable for all use of the Services if your account is misused and also for any and all stolen Services
                or fraudulent use of the Service. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, SFS shall not be
                liable to extend the subscription period or waive-off any fees on account of such theft or fraudulent
                use. This includes, but is not limited to, modem hijacking, wireless hijacking, or other fraud arising
                out of a failure of your internal or corporate security procedures. SFS will not issue refunds for
                fraudulent use resulting from your negligent or wilful acts or those of an authorized user of your
                Services.</li>
